# On Optimal and Objective-Specific Selection of Sequential Offers

A group project with Alessandro de Sanctis and Jan Rademacher. 

For the univariate case, we look at a nonparametric quantile estimator to solve a variant of the secretary problem: accepting an offer
within the top a% of the true distribution with high certainty. We obtain an upper bound using Chernoff Bounding.

For the multivariate case, we use the upper confidence bound algorithm from the family of multi-armed bandit techniques to make selections
on various (possibly correlated stocks). Our algorithm manages to outperform slightly our chosen benchmark of an equally-weighted portfolio.
