# adidas Hackathon Barcelona 2018

The future of retail is online. Retailers like adidas even offer free shipping and returns to entice people to shop online since an online model provides many advantages to the retailer in terms of promotions and cost-cutting. However, there are some consumers who remain skeptical of online shopping due to the uncertainty with regards to size and fit of the clothes on their body.

Our idea is to generate 3D body scans to obtain exact measurements of consumers and generating 3D models of their bodies to see how clothes will fit exactly on them (color, length, tightness etc.). Since this is more of a physics/engineering problem, we have adapted our solution to include size prediction based on the "shirt profile" of a certain design (the measurements of a certain shirt in all sizes) and the measurements of the person together with their fit preference (loose, regular, or tight fit).
