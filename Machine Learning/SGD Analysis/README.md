# Stochastic Gradient Descent and Big Regression

The goal of this project was two-fold. Firstly, I tried to modify the R sgd package by incorporating it into a function so that it could perform sgd on large, chunked FFDF objects. Secondly, I performed regression using the sgd package and compared it with the results obtained using the R biglm package.

# Contents

This directory contains the following elements:

* SGD Package Analysis - Kwa.pdf - an analysis of the R sgd package and various sgd methods
* code - folder containing the code I wrote to modify the R sgd package, perform big regression using sgd, and comparison with biglm package
* R objects folder, all the images and saved R objects like data frames can be found.
